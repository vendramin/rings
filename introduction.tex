\section*{Introduction}

The notes correspond to the bachelor 
course \textbf{Ring and Module Theory} of the 
Vrije Universiteit Brussel, 
Faculty of Sciences, 
Department of Mathematics and Data Sciences. The course
is divided into twelve two-hour lectures. 

The material is somewhat standard. Basic texts on abstract algebra
are for example \cite{MR1129886}, \cite{MR2286236} and \cite{MR600654}. 
Lang's book \cite{MR783636} is also a standard reference, but 
maybe a little bit more advanced. 
We based the lectures on the representation theory of finite
groups on \cite{MR0450380} and 
\cite{MR2867444}. 

The notes include many exercises, some with full detailed solutions. Mandatory exercises have a \colorbox{green!5!white}{green background}, while optional ones (bonus exercises) have a \colorbox{yellow!15!white}{yellow background}.
The notes also include some additional comments. While these are entirely optional, I hope they offer further insight. They are highlighted with a \colorbox{red!5!white}{pink background}.


We also mention a set of \href{https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/}{great expository papers} written 
by Keith Conrad. 
The notes are extremely well-written and are useful at  
every stage of a mathematical career. 

Several of the exercise solutions were written by Silvia Properzi.
